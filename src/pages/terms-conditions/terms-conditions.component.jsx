            <span>1. General terms and conditions</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            1.1 These general terms and conditions of sales are applicable to
            and are part of all sales agreements concluded by Monaki as seller
            of design furniture and various consumer goods (hereafter:
            “Monaki”).
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 Monaki does not accept any general terms and/or conditions of
            customer (hereafter: “Customer”), except if and in as far as any
            condition or conditions have been accepted by Monaki in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 If Monaki's order confirmation contains any conditions which
            deviate from these general conditions, the condition in Monaki's
            order-confirmation will prevail.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>2. Agreement</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            2.1 All offers and quotations of Monaki are without obligation and
            valid until 30 days after the date of being made.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2 All (on-line) sales by Monaki are confirmed by Monaki in writing
            (by e-mail, digital confirmation or by regular mail), and eventually
            approved and confirmed by a digitally confirmed sales contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.3 The Customer is also deemed to have accepted Monaki’s order if
            he has requested the execution of the order.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.4 Any (order) confirmation(s) from the Customer which deviates
            from Monaki’s order-confirmation, are only binding to Monaki if
            Monaki has accepted such deviations in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>3. Price and terms of payment</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            3.1 The price in Monaki’s order-confirmation is set fixed and
            without taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2 All taxes and excises of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter
            levied by governmental authority, whether federal, state or local,
            either directly or indirectly, upon the sale or transportation of
            any goods covered, shall be paid and borne by Customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3 Monaki is entitled to increase the price retroactively if the
            cost price determining factors have been subject to an increase.
            These factors include, but are not limited to: production costs, raw
            and auxiliary materials, energy, products or materials obtained by
            Monaki from third parties, taxes, levies, governmental charges,
            freight costs and insurance premiums. Monaki shall notify Customer
            of such increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4 Set-off or retention of payment by the Customer is not allowed,
            unless Monaki confirmed in writing that set-off or retention of
            payment is allowed by Customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.5 Customer shall be deemed to be in default without reminder or
            notice of default if it fails to effect payments due. Default
            interests may be charged at an annual rate of 12%.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.6 In all cases Monaki remains, without any restriction, owner of
            the goods until the moment that the Customer has fulfilled all
            commitment(s) and payment(s) in full has been received by Monaki.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.7 Upon completion additional storage fees of 1% of the total
            invoice price per week (with a minimum of EUR 50,- per week) will be
            charged to store merchandise if outstanding invoice balance is not
            paid in full and shipping arrangements have not been made within ten
            business days from the date of product reception from Monaki. The 1%
            charge will be compounding each week until outstanding invoice is
            paid in full and shipping arrangements have been paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.8 Monaki is entitled to command a minimum of 100% payment in
            advance against online sales of the goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.9 There are warranties with the goods of Monaki for the duration
            of 30 days after the Customer has purchased the goods. When issues
            arise, Monaki reserves the right to determine whether a replacement
            or repair is most appropriate. If Monaki decides to provide
            additional specific warranties regarding certain goods, this will be
            made clear in the order form. Warranties of Monaki explicitly do not
            apply to:
          </p>
          <p className='tab'>(1) water damages to the goods of Monaki;</p>
          <p className='tab'>
            (2) damages as a result of reparations by third parties without the
            consent of Monaki;
          </p>
          <p className='tab'>(3) adjustments to the goods of Monaki;</p>
          <p className='tab'>
            (4) wrongful maintenance of the goods of Monaki;
          </p>
          <p className='tab'>
            (5) if the goods of Monaki have been used for other purposes than
            intended by Monaki;
          </p>
          <p className='tab'>
            (6) extensive use of the goods of Monaki outdoor or in the rain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>4. Delivery and delays</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            4.1 Monaki is entitled to partial shipment of order. Each delivery
            can be seen as a separate contract. It is Customer ’s responsibility
            to insure that goods will fit through doors, windows and/or lift.
            Prices exclude delivery by a postal service. Transit time depends on
            the particular situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Monaki shall be released from the agreed delivery dates and
            periods to the extent that and as long as circumstances occur, which
            substantially impede performance. All difficulties, irrespective of
            their nature, the sphere and segment of the supply chain in which
            they occur, such as force majeure and acts of god (e.g. flooding,
            ice, loss of harvest, et cetera) export and import restrictions,
            problems in production, problems in procuring commodities,
            disruption of operations (breakdown of equipment or machinery, fire,
            et cetera), strikes, shortage of personnel or any similar actions,
            states of emergency or loading and transportation difficulties are
            deemed to be substantial impediments to performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 In the event of a substantial impediment to performance under
            clause 4.2, Monaki is entitled to rescind the contract with
            immediate effect without damages or extend the agreed delivery
            period by the duration of such impediment and time required to make
            adjustments or to be able to deliver. If such an extension period
            will be longer than two months, than Customer may rescind the
            agreement. If continuation of the agreement appears unreasonable for
            either party before the extension period has expired, that party may
            rescind or terminate the contract. Monaki shall give notice to the
            Customer of the duration of the extension period.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 In case of extension of delivery, Monaki is entitled but not
            obliged to supply goods equivalent to those agreed with Customer or
            to replace failed deliveries with third-party goods of equal value
            and quality within the extension period.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.5 In case Customer is in default with any obligation under the
            agreement with Monaki, than Monaki is entitled to postpone delivery
            by the same number of days as Customer was in arrears in addition to
            a reasonable period for making appropriate arrangements. Monaki is
            also entitled to suspend its own obligations as long as Customer is
            in default. In case Customer comes subject to bankruptcy law, Monaki
            may either suspend any obligations or cancel further deliveries; any
            loss or damages incurred by Customer ’s default is for the account
            of Customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.6 Because of applicable E.U. law Monaki is entitled to request
            Customer for duly certified copies of custom’s documents, certifying
            that the goods delivered by Monaki have been put into free
            circulation in the country of destination outside the E.U. Customer
            will hand these documents upon first request by Monaki.
